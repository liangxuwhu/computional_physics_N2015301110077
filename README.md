# Something about me
   Hello,eyeone.I'm an undergraduate in Wuhan University.Python fascinates me.I'm surprised to see some difficult physics probems solved by Python in simpler ways.Because this term is my first time to learn to how to use Python,to be honest,I'm not good at progamming.If you have some suggestions,please contact me. My e-mail is lxwhu@outlook.com.
## Life is short,why not python.
